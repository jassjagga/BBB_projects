//To control the beaglebone Black GPIO pins mannual from terminal 

//we can access the beaglebone Black GPIO pins by three ways 

1. Physical Pin name 
 eg: - PX_Y  (eg P9_12)

2. By gpio name 
eg: - GPIOX_Y (eg GPIO1_12)

3. By GPIO number 
eg: - 32*X+Y  (eg P9_12 = 60)

Example: -
//setting the Pin P9_12 by value 

//be a root 
    sudo su

//Go to the GPIO 

  cd /sys/class/gpio

  echo "pin number" > export 
eg 
  echo 60 > export 

  cd gpio60
//when we change it to out the pin is ready to output ( example like a connected LED will ready to start when value is change 
  to one
  
 echo "set direction" > direction
eg 
  echo out > direction
  echo in > direction
 
//To see the present value of pin 
  cat value 
//by changing the value we can turn on or off the connected LED 
//to set the value of the pin 
  echo 1 > value
